          <h3>Easter isn't just Good News, it's GREAT News!</h3>
          <p>
            Easter is not just a religious holiday with some sort of obligatory,
            religious significance. Easter is the celebration of a historical
            event that has immediate, practical relational and eternal
            ramifications for all of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Join us this Easter and let's discover together why it's not just
            good news but GREAT news!
          </p>

          <div>
            <h3>
              Join us for a virtual, interactive Good Friday Experience.

              walking us through the 7 Last Sayings of Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our hope is to draw our hearts into connection with the love of
              Jesus displayed on the cross
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll have you gather some common items and the service will walk
              us through these final phrases of Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are the things you will need to gather to be ready to
              participate in our Good Friday experience!

              <li>
                Something that brings them joy (picture / scent / blanket) open
                ended for you to grab something personal.

        <div class="invite-info">
          <p>
            Easter Egg Hunts are such a great time to pull the family together
            and spend intentional time as kids look for the eggs and get to
            celebrate in their findings. It is unfortunate we do not get to
            celebrate this tradition together with our community this year, but
            we want to encourage you and your family to engage this as
            creatively as you wish.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can have small Easter egg hunt hosted at your house for you and
            another family or just your family, check out the resource for DIY
            resurrection eggs and learn about ways to engage those with your
            family, dye some hard boiled eggs this year with your kids and while
            you do so talk to them about life, friends, and Jesus.
          </p>

          <p>
            This will be a different year but our hope is that people all over
            Lakewood and elsewhere look back at 2020 not saying, "oh man that
            was the year my life was shut down because of a virus" and instead
            say, "oh man that was the year that Jesus met in sweet ways and
            changed my life."
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a resource to do resurrection eggs:
