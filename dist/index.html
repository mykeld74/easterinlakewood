        <h3>Easter Changes Everything:</h3>
        <p>Easter is not just a celebration of spring, it is more than an excuse to search for eggs and eat candy, more than a remembrance of a historical event, even more than a religious celebration - <strong>Easter Changes Everything.</strong> Because of Easter our past doesn't have to determine our future, our identity is not rooted in our successes or our failures, our eyes are opened to an upside-down way of life that is full and meaningful. We are able to love in a way that is beyond us and we are connected to a power that drives out fear because it is bigger than any circumstance we are facing or will ever face!</p>
        <p>Join us this Easter as we start our new teaching series and let's discover together how Easter Changes Everthing.</p>

        <h3>Let's walk the ancient, scandalous way where all are included.</h3>
        <p>The Stations of the Cross represent the practice of pilgrims to Jerusalem, who would retrace the final journey of Jesus to the hill where he was crucified. These stations are a cross-section of elements, ideas, and objects from Jesus' journey. They help us understand that we are not troubled guests in this world, that we are not forgotten, and that Jesus expressed the good news of this season best when he said "in this world you'll experience many trials. But take heart! I have overcome the world."</p>
